Mathematical Modelling Project

### Aims

This project aims to reproduce and build on the results of 1991 study 'Modeling the cell division cycle: cdc2 and cyclin interactions' by John Tyson (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC52288/pdf/pnas01066-0438.pdf) 

The 1991 study models the changing levels of active Metaphase Promoting Factor (MPF) through the production and degradation of the cyclin compunent along with the autocatalytic dephosporylation of cyclin-P-cdc2-P to cyclin-P-cdc2 - in essence the auto-activation of MPF. 



Tyson showed that a single system of 5 differential equations was able to model three modes of action that have been observed in different cell types: 
- steady state MFP levels in metaphase-arrested unfertilized eggs
- spontaneous oscillations in rapidly-dividing early embryos
- excitable swith in growth-controlled division of somatic cells
